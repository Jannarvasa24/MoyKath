Till you moved with your pen, changin' moods now and then Till the balance was right, Then you added some music Every note was in place And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face And you decorated my life Created a world Where dreams are a part And you decorated my life By paintin' your love all over my heart You decorated my life Like a rhyme with no reason In an unfinished song There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me until you came along And you brought out the colors What a gentle surprise Now I'm able to see all the things life can be, shinin' soft in your eyes And you decorated my life Created a world Where dreams are a part And you decorated my life By paintin' your love All over my heart You decorated my life. All my life was a paper Once plain, pure and white. Till you moved with your pen, changin' moods now and then Till the balance was right, Then you added some music Every note was in place And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face And you decorated my life Created a world Where dreams are a part And you decorated my life By paintin' your love all over my heart You decorated my life Like a rhyme with no reason In an unfinished song There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me until you came along And you brought out the colors What a gentle surprise Now I'm able to see all the things life can be, shinin' soft in your eyes And you decorated my life Created a world Where dreams are a part And you decorated my life By paintin' your love All over my heart You decorated my life. All my life was a paper Once plain, pure and white. Till you moved with your pen, changin' moods now and then Till the balance was right, Then you added some music Every note was in place And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face And you decorated my life Created a world Where dreams are a part And you decorated my life By paintin' your love all over my heart You decorated my life Like a rhyme with no reason In an unfinished song There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me until you came along And you brought out the colors What a gentle surprise Now I'm able to see all the things life can be, shinin' soft in your eyes And you decorated my life Created a world Where dreams are a part And you decorated my life By paintin' your love All over my heart You decorated my life.
